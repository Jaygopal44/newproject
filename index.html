               <p class="sectionSabTag text-small">The Rogel Cancer Center's Complementary Therapy Program does not
                    offer acupressure services, or classes, but recognizes the benefits of it. Therefore, the following
                    information is provided. This service may be offered in the future.

                    Acupressure is an ancient form of massage that is one of the treatment methods used in Traditional
                    Chinese Medicine. The goal of acupressure (as well as other Chinese Medicine treatments), is to
                    encourage the movement of qi ("life energy") through the 14 channels (meridians) inside the body.
                    These are the same energy meridians and acupoints as those targeted with acupuncture. Chinese
                    Medicine theory states that the constant flow of qi through these channels is essential for a person
                    to keep their health. If this energy flow is blocked, the body can no longer maintain the balance
                    that is needed to maintain high energy and deal with health issues.

                    Acupressure consists of pressing the acupuncture points in an attempt to help the free flow of
                    energy in the channel(s). Acupressure is similar to acupuncture, but the person uses their fingers
                    instead of needles to work the point. During a treatment or self treatment, a person will experience
                    a slight pain when the proper acupuncture point is pressed.

                    Tuina is the most popular form of acupressure performed in China and is part of the training of most
                    acupuncturists trained in the United States. Other forms are shen tao, which uses very light
                    pressure applied only with the fingertips, and a Japanese form, anma, which has developed into a
                    popular form now recognized as shiatsu.</p>

               <p class="sectionSabTag text-small">cupressure can be very effective in helping with nausea and vomiting
                    after surgery or invasive medical procedures. Acupressure can also help in reducing the pain.

                    There has not been a lot of research done to document the benefits of acupressure, although there
                    has been some. According to the National Cancer Institute, several small studies have shown that
                    acupressure has helped cancer patients by reducing cancer-related fatigue and nausea. Many patients
                    report acupressure has also helped with pain, stress and anxiety but there has not been research
                    done specifically with cancer patients documenting these results.</p>
